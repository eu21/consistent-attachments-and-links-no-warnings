## Make Obsidian images work on Github

This plugin allows to upload images on github and render them on the page correctly by changing format to markup style

### Automation ready now
I have automated this plugin with cron plugin, but too many notice reports as started to flood the screen. And this plugin had no option to disable popup notices. So I just removed notifications.
